Break into more than one.</li> <li>Are there any useful parts that can be extracted?</li> <li>Can another funciton be resued here?</li> </ul> <p class='question'>Do more thinking on: breaking down a funciton into multiple functions to give them descriptive names to make the code more readable vs. breaking it down only to resuable code junks.</p> </section> <section> <h4>Arrow Functions</h4> <p>These have always confused me when I have seen them. They are shorthand for anonymous functions and changes what <i>this</i> means in their scope.</p> <pre class='code'>function(x){return x+1;} //is the same as x => x + 1; </pre> <p>I have seen these before in find functions. Array.find(x => x > 5). Previously, these did not make sense. .find feeds in an argument to x, an element, and then it returns if x > 5.</p> </section> <section> <h4>Bubbling</h4> <p>When an event happens (whatever that means) it is sent up the DOM tree, moving from parent to parent. Every parent can have a listener and hear an event.</p> <p>event.target = the elemtent clicked on. event.currentTarget = element that listener is on.</p> <p>This has a lot of potential to usee when dealing with lots of buttons. The element above them holds the listener, not each button. Will have to do more research into the best ways to implement this.</p> </section> <section> <h4>Hoisting</h4> <p>Javascript sifts through the script and moves var and function to top of the file. Only the declaration is hoisted--it sets aside a data slot for their refrence name, but it does not assign a value.</p> </section> <section> <h4>Random</h4> <p>Order functions that will be called in another function before the function that calls them.

            "content":" <article> <section> <h4>Javascript Gold</h4> <p>Another student and a TA were working on a project for a while, and they figured out you can label a for loop (using similar syntax to a Javascript object). One would be able to break out of an above loop while in a nested loop. You can also continue. </p> <h5>Break Example</h5> <pre> myForLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i ++){ if(i === 2){ break myForLoop; } console.log(i); } </pre> <h5>Continue Example</h5> <p>I wonder how continue and break would differ in the example below. After running them, it looks like <i>continue</i> goes back up to the top of the for loop that it is directed to and increments it, while <i>break</i> stops the the current loop and continues onto the code after it.</p> <pre> myForLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){ if(i === 2){ for(let x = 0; x < 7; x++){ if(x === 3){ continue myForLoop; } console.log('x', x); } } console.log('i', i); } // Output // i 0 // i 1 // x 0 // x 1 // x 2 // i 3 // i 4 </pre> <pre> myForLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){ if(i === 2){ for(let x = 0; x < 7; x++){ if(x === 3){ break; } console.log('x', x); } } console.log('i', i); } // Output // i 0 // i 1 // x 0 // x 1 // x 2 // i 2 // i 3 // i 4 </pre> <h4><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label'>MDN Docs Example</a></h4> <pre> let i, j; loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) { //The first for statement is labeled 'loop1' loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) { //The second for statement is labeled 'loop2' if (i === 1 && j === 1) { break loop1; } console.log('i = ' + i + ', j = ' + j); } } // Output is: // 'i = 0, j = 0' // 'i = 0, j = 1' // 'i = 0, j = 2' // 'i = 1, j = 0' // Notice the difference with the previous continue example</pre> </section> <section> <h4>Annoying Things Encountered</h4> <p>Learned that addEventListener (at least in the xample below) does not take arrow functions. It will take anonymous functions, just not arrow functions. I'm probably missing something.</p> <pre> function loadData(animal, outputId){ const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', `${animal}Products.json`); xhr.addEventListener('load', () => { // Does not work! data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); createTable(outputId, animal); }); xhr.send(); } </pre> <pre> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 </pre> <pre> function loadData(animal, outputId){ const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', `${animal}Products.json`); xhr.addEventListener('load', function() { // Does work! data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); createTable(outputId, animal); }); xhr.send(); } </pre> </section> <section> <h4>SASS</h4> <p>Today was the first day that I have worked in SASS.</p> <ul> <li>@mixin creates a function. Refer to it with @include.</li> <li>@import imports another sass file.</li> <li>& refers to this. $:hover</li> <li>% creates a function whose values cannot be changed.</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h4>Javascript Sort</h4> <p>To sort an array from largest to smallest, I see the below a lot on Google. </p> <pre> [34, 24, 29, 3].sort(function(a, b){return b - a}); </pre> <p>After Joe Shepherd, the NSS instructor explained it, it looks like .sort feeds 34 and 24 as a and b, and returns the subtracted value of 10. 10 would mean that the second number is smaller than the first, so 24 would go after 34. It repeats this until the numbers are greatest to smallest. The next two numbers would be 24 and 29, which would return -5, so .sort would put 29 before 24.</p> </section> <section> <h4>Cool Things</h4> <p>Joe Shepherd, the NSS instructor, showed use the below code to augment a module. The part I am intiuged by is the (tree || {}) statment at the bottom. Meaning, if tree is false (it is undefined) then use an empty object as the argument, otherwise use tree. This works, because if tree is undefined, it returns false.</p> <p>The fact that tree returns false if undefined interests me. This is a basic building block in Javascript, and something that I would not have come up with by myself. It makes me look at other syntax I take for granted, like an IIFE stament being enclosed in parenthesis in this example <span class='code'>(function() { alert('hey!'); })();</span> The parenthesis aren't just arbitrary syntax used to say 'hey! This is an IIFE!' They are a basic building block, serving a basic function, used to create this IIFE statment. </p> <p>The primary way it occurs to me to use it right now would be with function arguments. If x isn't provided, then do this. But I think there is other ways that this could be utilized. </p> <pre> var tree = (function(originalTree) { let randomVar = 'protected'; originalTree.outputToDOM = () => { let myTree = tree.getTreeSpecies(); document.getElementById('myTree').innerHTML = `My fave tree is a ${ myTree } tree`; }; return originalTree; })(tree || {}); </pre> </section> <section> <h4>Questions</h4> <ul> <li>Research Execution Context to have a greater understanding of <i>this</i> when using arrow functions.</li> </ul> </section> </article>"

If, for example, you wanted to check a value and depending on it return a different value, you could use a number of if statments like below.</p> <pre>let x = 5; <br/> if(x === 5){ <br/> console.log('The value is 5.'); <br/> } else if(x === 6){ <br/> console.log('The value is 6'); <br/> } </pre> <p>This works, but it looks ugly, and is hard to deal with. Here is another to set it up..</p> <pre>let x = 5; <br/> let values = { <br/> 5: 'The value is 5.', <br/> 6: 'The value is 6.' <br/> } <br/> <br/> for(property in values){ <br/> if(property === x){ <br/> consolelog(values[property]); <br/> } <br/> } </pre> </article> <article> <h4>Calling functions with strings using Module.Exports</h4> <p>In this NSS <a href='https://github.com/nashville-software-school/front-end-milestones/blob/master/2-single-page-applications/exercises/SP_JS_MODULE_SANDWICH.md'>exercise</a>, they ask you to create a module for different sandiwch toppings (cheese, meat, condiments, etc.) They want each to have a function that says add{topping} (addCheese(), addMeat(), addCondiments()). The problem with this, is that I couldn't loop through an array of these objects, because each has a unique function. At first, I removed the topping name, and just added add() on each module. Doing this, I could loop through an array, and call add() on each, and the topping would be added to my sandwich.</p> <p>After looking at it for a while, I realized an alternate method. Because we were creating modules with Browserify, if you want a funciton to be public, you assign ot to the Module.Exports object, like so: </p> <pre> module.exports = { <br/> addMeat, <br/> addCheese, <br/> addCondiments }; </pre> <p>addMeat, since it has the same name as the function, is shorthand for addMeat: addMeat. The first value is a string, because this is a Javascript Object. Meaning, you can reference this function using a string. Therefore, you can loop over an array of toppings and call the function, if you know the topping name. Toppings[x][`$add{toppingName}`].</p> </article> <article> <h4>Questions: Read 'Expert' JS Programmer's Code to Learn</h4> </article> </section>"
