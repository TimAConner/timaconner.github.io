module.exports.function();

Module exports is an object, so to refer to one within a function you can say that.  Function is 
a string also.  So, can you do module.exports[${functionName}]




2 (NOPE THIS DOESNT WORK AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD.)
Objects pass references.  meaning, if you want a function to have control of variables, pass that variable in an object, not just itself.  If you pass itself, it will be passed as a value.

script.doThis({
array: thisArray
});

doThis (obj) {
obj.array = [];
}
