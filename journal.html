                <!-- 
                    Don't be emberassed to talk about lack of understanding.
                    Try something for the hell of it.
                    Embrace begginer mentality.
                        Love being a beginner.
                    Try to ask questions without qualifiers--"How do you add a javascript file?  I know you type <script>""  As Jufe said, say "I have this, and I'm tryin to make this."  This way, you won't lose valuable information by trying to make it know that you know something.
                    If you've made it work but you don't know why, be sure to go back and learn how it works.  You're here to be made hireable, not to complete projects.

                    Pull Request Should Include:
                        Why you want to merge master.
                            Make an argument.  "This belongs in the master because...."
                        What the code does.
                        How the code does it.

                    The commit messeges should be chapter headings of the story of production.
                    Only push when a feature is complete.

                    Before your push, pull into your master and merge your branch with master locally to peice through merge conflicts.
                    
                    When checking other peoplep's code, use git fetch to get all branches.  Then, run the code locally to double check that it works.  VS Code makes checking merge errors easy.

                 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                 <!--
                     Don't do any extra styling or coding until you have a functioning page (met MVP).
                 -->
                 <!--
                     Avoid styling IDs.  Use IDs for Javacript and class for CSS.  ID will override class, even if the class is at the bottom of the cascade.
                     So, if you need to style an element, even if it has an id, add a class.
                 -->
                 <h3>Retrospectives & Feedback to Others</h3>
                 <!--
                 After you are done completing a SPRINT, look back at the sprint with your group.  Make note of things you want to stop doing, keep doing, and start doing.  After you've done this, go through item by item to check whether or not the whole group agrees.

                Make sure that you have gone through every line of yours and other's code,  you could say what it says.

                 Frame the feedback so you have the code's best interest in mind.  Don't say, "You're not following the best practice."  Say, "The code will get messy if we don't follow best practices."

                <!--New information:
                    array.forEach(function(){
                        Slower than for loop, and you can't break out of it, but is a quick short hand.
                    });

                    Learned about template literals today.  You put the string inside `ticks` and you can then run javascript inside it with ${} without having to use pluses and concatanating a string.

                    "hello".repeat(3)
                    It took me a few glances to understand this code.  And then it hit me: "hello" is an object--a string that .repeat is a method of.  This looks a little alien, sim1ilar to the template literals, to what I am used to seeing in code,

                <!-- 
                    In a pull request, include why this should be added to master.
                    Before you push, pull master and merge locally.  *I need to ask the best way to do this using windows git bash.*
                    When testing another's branch, use git fetch to run through their branch locally.  You don't need to merge it.
                    Delete branches after they have been merged.

                <!--
                    Almost every object inherits from __proto__.
                    If a property is not on a child, Javasript will search through the its prototype to see if a property is there.  If not on that prototype, it goes up the prototype chain until it can or can't find it, in which case it returns undefined.

                    Object.create(objectName) will create a prototype chain.  

                    Access the prototype through objectName.__proto__.

                <h3>Remember To/That:</h3>
                <!--
                    Ask questions in the form: "I am trying to make this, and this is what I have."  Doing this will cut down on me trying to state what I know before I ask the question, which is counter productive when I am trying to learn.

                    Object.create() vs new objectName
                    Is Object.create({}) === Object.create(__proto__)?

                <section>
                    <h4>SOLID Principles -- Single Responsiblity</h4>
                    <p>Functions that do one thing, that have one clear responsibility.  Err on the side of smaller functions.</p>
                    <h5>S Check List</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't have functions that would have a name addElementsAndDeleteElements.  Break into more than one.</li>
                        <li>Are there any useful parts that can be extracted?</li>
                        <li>Can another funciton be resued here?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="question">Do more thinking on: breaking down a funciton into multiple functions to give them descriptive names to make the code more readable vs. breaking it down only to resuable code junks.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Arrow Functions</h4>
                    <p>These have always confused me when I have seen them.  They are shorthand for anonymous functions and changes what <i>this</i> means in their scope.</p>
                    <pre>
function(x){
    return x+1;
} 

is the same as 

x => x + 1;
                    </pre>
                    <p>I have seen these before in find functions.  Array.find(x => x > 5).  Previously, these did not make sense.  .find feeds in an argument to x, an element, and then it returns if x > 5.</p>

                <section>
                    <h4>Bubbling</h4>
                    <p>When an event happens (whatever that means) it is sent up the DOM tree, moving from parent to parent.  Every parent can have a listener and hear an event.</p>
                    <p>event.target = the elemtent clicked on.  event.currentTarget = element that listener is on.</p>
                    <p>This has a lot of potential to usee when dealing with lots of buttons.  The element above them holds the listener, not each button.  Will have to do more research into the best ways to implement this.</p>

                    <h4>Hoisting</h4>
                    <p>Javascript sifts through the script and moves var and function to top of the file.  Only the declaration is hoisted--it sets aside a data slot for their refrence name, but it does not assign a value.</p>
