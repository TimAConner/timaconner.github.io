                <h4>Chrome Console Logs</h4>
                <p>Console log outputs the last state of the object, not what the value was when it was called.  If you load JSON with an XHR, and check the value of the XHR object while loading it, the value outputted will be the completed XHR object.</p>

                <h4>If Statment Assignment</h4>
                <pre>X is set to one in the first.  Will it then go onto the code inside?  Does x = 1 evaluate as 'true', so it then goes into the code to execute?</pre>
                <pre> Here's an intersting site I found talking about using this as a utility. <a href='https://www.sitepoint.com/assignment-inside-a-condition/'>Assignment Inside a Condition</a>  It looks like you can test where it exists, and assign it if it does, in the same if stamtent.  It works because the assignment returns a value.  So far in testing, assignment inside a condition evaluates as true unless it is false or undefined.</pre>
                <pre>
                    if(x === 1){

                    }
                    if(x = 1){

                    }
                    if(x=false){console.log("test");}
                    // undefined
                    if(x=true){console.log("test")}
                    // VM4783:1 test

                    //From the Assignment Inside a Condition 
                        //btn-create is on the page
                        if(summary = document.getElementById('btn-create'))
                        {
                            console.log(summary);
                        }
                        // VM265:3 <button id=​'btn-create'>​Create​</button>​
                        // undefined
                        if(summary = document.getElementById('btn-crea'))

                    {console.log('hey')}
                    // undefined
                    if(x = undefined){console.log('hey')}
                    // undefined

                <h4>Alternate If Statment</h4>
                <p>I use if statments often, but last week I stumbled across a different way off thinking about this.  If, for example, you wanted to check a value and depending on it return a different value, you could use a number of if statments like below.</p>
                <pre>
                    let x = 5;
                    if(x === 5){
                        console.log("The value is 5.");
                    } else if(x === 6){
                        console.log("The value is 6");
                    }
                </pre>
                <p>This works, but it looks ugly, and is hard to deal with.  Here is another to set it up..</p>
                <pre>
                    let x = 5;
                    let values = {
                        5: "The value is 5.",
                        6: "The value is 6."
                    }

                    for(property in values){
                        if(property === x){
                            consolelog(values[property]);
                        }
                    }

            <h5>Javascript Gold</h5>
            
            <p>Another student and a TA were working on a project for a while, and they figured out you can label a for loop (using similar syntax to a Javascript object).  One would be  able to break out of an above loop while in a nested loop.  You can also continue. </p>
            <h6>Break Example</h6>
            <pre>
                myForLoop:
                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i ++){
                    if(i === 2){
                        break myForLoop;
                    }
                    console.log(i);
                }

            </pre>
            <h6>Continue Example</h6>
            <p>I wonder how continue and break would differ in the example below.  After running them, it looks like <i>continue</i> goes back up to the top of the for loop that it is directed to and increments it, while <i>break</i> stops the the current loop and continues onto the code after it.</p>
            <pre>
                myForLoop:
                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
                    if(i === 2){
                        for(let x = 0; x < 7; x++){
                            if(x === 3){
                                continue myForLoop;
                            }
                            console.log('x', x);
                        }
                    }
                    console.log('i', i);
                }
                // Output
                // i 0
                // i 1
                // x 0
                // x 1
                // x 2
                // i 3
                // i 4
            </pre>
            <pre>
                myForLoop:
                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
                    if(i === 2){
                        for(let x = 0; x < 7; x++){
                            if(x === 3){
                                break;
                            }
                            console.log('x', x);
                        }
                    }
                    console.log('i', i);
                }
                // Output
                // i 0
                // i 1
                // x 0
                // x 1
                // x 2
                // i 2

            <h5>Annoying Things Encountered</h5>
            <p>Learned that addEventListener (at least in the xample below) does not take arrow functions.  It will take anonymous functions, just not arrow functions.  I'm probably missing something.</p>
            <pre>
                function loadData(animal, outputId){
                    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
                    xhr.open("GET", `${animal}Products.json`);

                    xhr.addEventListener("load", () => { // Does not work!

                        data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
                        createTable(outputId, animal);
                    });
                    xhr.send();   
                }

            <h5>Javascript Sort</h5>
            <p>To sort an array from largest to smallest, I see the below a lot on Google. </p>
            <pre>
                [34, 24, 29, 3].sort(function(a, b){return b - a});
            </pre>
            <p>After Joe Shepherd, the NSS instructor explained it, it looks like .sort feeds 34 and 24 as a and b, and returns the subtracted value of 10.  10 would mean that the second number is smaller than the first, so 24 would go after 34.  It repeats this until the numbers are greatest to smallest.  The next two numbers would be 24 and 29, which would return -5, so .sort would put 29 before 24.</p>

            <h5>Cool Things</h5>
            <p>Joe Shepherd, the NSS instructor, showed use the below code to augment a module.  The part I am intiuged by is the (tree || {}) statment at the bottom.  Meaning, if tree is false (it is undefined) then use an empty object as the argument, otherwise use tree.  This works, because if tree is undefined, it returns false.</p>
            <p>The fact that tree returns false if undefined interests me.  This is a basic building block in Javascript, and something that I would not have come up with by myself.  It makes me look at other syntax I take for granted, like an IIFE stament being enclosed in parenthesis in this example <span class='code'>(function() {
                alert('hey!');
            })();</span>  The parenthesis aren't just arbitrary syntax used to say 'hey! This is an IIFE!'  They are a basic building block, serving a basic function, used to create this IIFE statment.  </p>
            <p>The primary way it occurs to me to use it right now would be with function arguments.  If x isn't provided, then do this.  But I think there is other ways that this could be utilized.  </p>
            <pre>
                var tree = (function(originalTree) {
                    let randomVar = "protected";
                    
                    originalTree.outputToDOM = () => {
                        let myTree = tree.getTreeSpecies();
                        document.getElementById("myTree").innerHTML = `My fave tree is a ${
                        myTree
                        } tree`;
                    };
                    
                    return originalTree;
                    })(tree || {});
