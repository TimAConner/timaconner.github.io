                <h3>Notes Interaction:</h3>
                <!-- 
                    Don't be emberassed to talk about lack of understanding.
                    Try something for the hell of it.
                    Embrace begginer mentality.
                        Love being a beginner.
                    Try to ask questions without qualifiers--"How do you add a javascript file?  I know you type <script>""  As Jufe said, say "I have this, and I'm tryin to make this."  This way, you won't lose valuable information by trying to make it know that you know something.
                    If you've made it work but you don't know why, be sure to go back and learn how it works.  You're here to be made hireable, not to complete projects.

                 <h3>Git</h3>
                 <!--
                     

                    Pull Request Should Include:
                        Why you want to merge master.
                            Make an argument.  "This belongs in the master because...."
                        What the code does.
                        How the code does it.

                    The commit messeges should be chapter headings of the story of production.
                    Only push when a feature is complete.

                    Before your push, pull into your master and merge your branch with master locally to peice through merge conflicts.
                    
                    When checking other peoplep's code, use git fetch to get all branches.  Then, run the code locally to double check that it works.  VS Code makes checking merge errors easy.

                 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                 <!--
                     Don't do any extra styling or coding until you have a functioning page (met MVP).
                 -->
                 <!--
                     Avoid styling IDs.  Use IDs for Javacript and class for CSS.  ID will override class, even if the class is at the bottom of the cascade.
                     So, if you need to style an element, even if it has an id, add a class.
                 -->
                 <h3>Retrospectives & Feedback to Others</h3>
                 <!--
                 After you are done completing a SPRINT, look back at the sprint with your group.  Make note of things you want to stop doing, keep doing, and start doing.  After you've done this, go through item by item to check whether or not the whole group agrees.

                Make sure that you have gone through every line of yours and other's code,  you could say what it says.

                 Frame the feedback so you have the code's best interest in mind.  Don't say, "You're not following the best practice."  Say, "The code will get messy if we don't follow best practices."
